I created these figures to explain concepts related to social network analysis. To read the article that these figures were made for, go to [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X17302853](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56400790e4b01aca66bb9831/t/5b2be2280e2e72799a82373c/1529602605386/Weaverdyck%2C+Parkinson_2018_Current+Opinion+in+Psychology.pdf).
