I am currently a graduate student in the [UCLA Computational Social neuroscience Lab](http://csnlab.org/). I attended [Bethel College, KS](https://www.bethelks.edu/) for undergrad, graduating with B.A.s in Psychology and Mathematical Sciences. After college, I worked as a lab manager for the [Rutgers Laboratory for Developmental Language Studies](https://sites.rutgers.edu/language-studies/), then the [Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab](https://psnlab.princeton.edu/).

Broadly, I study how the broader contexts of the perceiver and target shape social thought and behavior. I implement a multi-faceted approach in my research, including functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), novel behavioral tasks, and social network analysis. Currently, her work focuses on how people acquire, neurally encode, and then use social network information.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
