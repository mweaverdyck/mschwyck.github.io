I am a sixth-year graduate student in the [UCLA Computational Social neuroscience Lab](http://csnlab.org/). I attended Bethel College, KS, graduating with B.A.s in Psychology and Mathematical Sciences. After college, I spent several years working outside of academia and in various academic labs. I take a multi-faceted approach, including functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), behavioral tasks, and social network analysis, to study how the broader contexts of the perceiver and target shape social thought and behavior. Currently, her work focuses on how people acquire, neurally encode, and then use social network information.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
